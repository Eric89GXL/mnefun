mnefun
======

This is a library designed to facilitate ILABS MEG pipeline development
through integration with mne-python.

DO NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPORT IF YOU ARE A USER OUTSIDE THE ILABS COMMUNITY.
A great deal of this code is tailored specifically for use at ILABS.

An example processing pipeline is here:

https://github.com/LABSN/mnefun/blob/master/examples/funloc/analysis_fun.py

And the flow of the pipeline is visualized here:
